WRITE CODE 
1) To begin your assignment, find the src/classwork/04_assign folder.  Under this folder:
      a) In file src/classwork/04_assign/loops.h, write function prototype for a value-return function named factorial that accepts
     an int parameter named num and  returns an int. 
      b) In file src/classwork/04_assign/loops.cpp, write the function code that returns the factorial of num using 
          a loop of your choice.  Do not use a recursive solution to solve this problem.
